   we propose a LiDAR-based reliable global localization method exploiting the verifiable cues in the sequential LiDAR data. Reliable-loc mainly consists of spatial verification-based Monte Carlo localization and localization status monitoring mechanism guided pose uncertainties. The experimental results indicate that Reliable-loc exhibits high robustness, accuracy, and efficiency in large-scale, complex street scenes, with a position accuracy of 1.66m, yaw accuracy of 3.09 degrees, and achieves real-time performance.
